# Personal Website

Angular 7 website currently live at [sidb.dev](sidb.dev)

## User Interface

Carefully designed the user interface to portray my professional profile as well as make it easy to read. For this reason, the desktop view is more **geeky** that presents myself in a few lines of code. The mobile version is a more reader-friendly version focusing on the understandability aspect. 

Included icons for easy access to my resume and portfolio.
